# Code review

The contributor in charge of doing the code review should check the following points:

* Am I able to understand the code easily?
* Is the code written following the coding standards/guidelines? see [nodejs coding style](https://medium.com/swlh/node-js-coding-style-guidelines-74a20d00c40b)
* Is the same code duplicated more than twice?
* Are unit tests present and carried out successfully? ?
* Is this function or class too big? If yes, is the function or class having too many responsibilities?
